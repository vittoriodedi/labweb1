This repository contains my ‚ÄúLaboratorio Programmazione Web 1‚Äù course final project.

## Overview

The goal of the course was to design and develop modern, functional websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP**. The course project was split into two major parts: an introductory static website and a more advanced dynamic web application simulating a real-world pharmacy service.

## Contents

* üìÅ **`Avigliano Umbro/`** ‚Äì A **static website** created at the beginning of the course. It presents and promotes the town of Avigliano Umbro, focusing on:

  * Tourist attractions
  * Local history and culture
  * Multimedia content (images, videos)
  * Mobile-responsive layout using CSS and flex/grid design

* üìÅ **`Esame/`** ‚Äì The **main final project**: a fully functional web application for a fictional pharmacy called **Pharmanova**. It includes:

    * **Authentication system** with login and user session management (HTML/PHP-based)
    * **Product ordering system** with QR code generation for in-store pickup
    * **Booking and reservation system** for health services (blood tests, consultations, etc.)
    * **Pharmacist dashboard** for viewing, confirming or rejecting appointments
    * **User interface** for managing personal reservations and service requests
    * Server-side and client-side validation, session persistence, and interaction logic

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates the practical skills acquired throughout the *Laboratorio Programmazione Web I* course, including:

* Static and dynamic web design
* Backend logic using PHP
* Frontend interactivity with JavaScript
* Real-world use case simulation (e.g., managing services in a pharmacy)
* Creating user-friendly, role-based web applications
